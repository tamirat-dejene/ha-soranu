# Ha-Soranu 🍱

**Ha-Soranu** is a scalable, microservices-based online food delivery platform built with Go. It enables users to browse restaurants, view menus, and place orders through a modern, distributed architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture using **gRPC** for inter-service communication and an **API Gateway** to expose RESTful endpoints to clients.

    end
```

### Core Services

| Service | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **[api-gateway](./services/api-gateway)** | REST API | Entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, transformation (HTTP ↔ gRPC), and initial validation. |
| **[auth-service](./services/auth-service)** | gRPC | Manages user identity, authentication (JWT, OAuth), and profiles. |
| **[restaurant-service](./services/restaurant-service)** | gRPC | Manages restaurant profiles, menus, and order processing. Publishes order events to Kafka. |

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Communication**: gRPC (Inter-service), REST (Client-facing)
- **Frameworks**: 
  - [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) (HTTP Gateway)
  - [gRPC-Go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) (RPC)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (Per-service databases)
- **Caching**: Redis (Token storage, session management)
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka (Event-driven architecture)
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - Docker & Kubernetes (Containerization & Orchestration)
  - [Tilt](https://tilt.dev) (Local Development Environment)
- **Tooling**: Make, Goose (Migrations)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

The easiest way to run the entire platform locally is using **Tilt**.

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/) (Minikube)
- [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Running Locally

1. **Start your Kubernetes cluster** (if not running):
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

2. **Run Tilt**:
   ```bash
   tilt up
   ```
   This will build all services, deploy them to Kubernetes, and set up port forwarding.

3. **Access the Application**:
   - **API Gateway**: `http://localhost:8080`
   - **Tilt UI**: `http://localhost:10350` (to monitor logs and status)

## 🔧 Development

### Working with Protos

Protocol buffers are the contract between services. If you modify files in `protos/`, you must regenerate the Go code:

```bash
make proto
```

### Database Migrations

Each service manages its own database schema using **Goose**.

```bash
# Example: Create a new migration for auth-service
cd services/auth-service
goose -dir migrations postgres "user=postgres dbname=authdb sslmode=disable" create add_new_table sql
```
